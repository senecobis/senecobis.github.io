We introduce RAMP-VO, the first end-to-end learned image- and event-based VO system. It leverages novel Recurrent, Asynchronous,
and Massively Parallel (RAMP) encoders capable of fusing asynchronous events with image data, providing 8Ã— faster
inference and 33% more accurate predictions than existing solutions, paving the way for robust and asynchronous VO
in space. Despite being trained only in simulation, RAMP-VO outperforms previous methods on the newly introduced Apollo
and Malapert datasets, and on existing benchmarks, where it improves image- and event-based methods by 58.8% and 30.6%,
paving the way for robust and asynchronous VO in space.
