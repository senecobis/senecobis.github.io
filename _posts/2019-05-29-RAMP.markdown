We introduce RAMP-VO, the first end-to-end learned event- and image-based VO system. It leverages novel Recurrent, Asynchronous, and Massively Parallel (RAMP) encoders that are 8Ã— faster and 20% more accurate than existing asynchronous encoders. RAMP-VO further employs a novel pose forecasting technique to predict future poses for initialization. Despite being trained only in simulation, RAMP- VO outperforms image- and event-based methods by 52% and 20%.
