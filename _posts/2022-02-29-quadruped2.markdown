The aim of this project is mainly do design my first working (and walking) robot, soon I will publish a youtube video explaining my journey. I started by design using Shapr3D the leg of the robot. 
My objective was to put all servos higher up to decrease inertia of the leg. Then I designed a part (You can see in the video the low-diameter stick connecting the higher part of the leg with lower part) which should server as shock absorption as it is made of a semi-flexible PLA. Then I tried different configurations and design of the leg, printing them and finally settled for the current.
At this point I started to design the body of the robot, which is basically the hull of an extruded ellipse. I designed the body such that can be printed in two parts which then can be assembled together. This to avoid wasting material of my 3d printer.
In the current stage I printed the first half of the body, connected the first leg to it and tested the electronics that should control the legs.
