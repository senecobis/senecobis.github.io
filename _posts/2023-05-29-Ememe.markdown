I created together with my team at Ememe a: Learning Based RPG Life Simulation with generative NPCs behavior and Automated story creation.
All the characters are commanded by LLMs, they have thoughts, they can reason and have a will. They also share memories and can act with the world the same way the main character does. Users can interact with NPCs by injecting natural language thoughts inside them.
Each new character living in this town can be created ground-up: by setting their personalities, their aspirations, their daily schedules and their looks and animations.
