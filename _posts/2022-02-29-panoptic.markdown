In this work, we investigate a solution to speed up model inference of novel vision Transformers for segmentation and object tracking.
First, we focus on state of the art network used for object detection and image segmentation: DETR. We develop an approach to convert the model from PyTorch to TensorRT that can reduce the computational cost and memory footprint signifi- cantly.
Second, we investigate DETRâ€™s potential towards online object instance segmenta- tion by investigating TrackFormer, a model that by itself makes use of DETR. We can show promising results in the video segmentation domain, and train the model using small datasets for tracking a specific objects.
